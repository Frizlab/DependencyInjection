= DependencyInjection
Fran√ßois Lamboley <fload@me.com>

A dependency injection solution, loosely inspired by https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/dependency-injection/.

== Example of Use

Define the service
[source,swift]
----
class ConnectionService { ... }

private struct ConnectionServiceKey : InjectionKey {
   static var currentValue: ConnectionService = ConnectionService()
}

extension InjectedValues {
   var connectionService: ConnectionService {
      get {Self[ConnectionServiceKey.self]}
      set {Self[ConnectionServiceKey.self] = newValue}
   }
}
----

And use it
[source,swift]
----
@Injected(\.connectionService)
var connectionService: ConnectionService
----
